      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve given a short talk at DevOpsDays Florian√≥polis on Helm, Kubernetes de-facto release manager tool. I&amp;rsquo;ve aptly named it &amp;ldquo;What the Helm!?&amp;rdquo; (a play on words with &amp;ldquo;What the Hell!?&amp;rdquo;), and then gave myself a nice pat on the back. Still, being incapable of ever doing something original, I immediately found out that the joke had been published already. Twice.
In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed a few Helm pitfalls, specially if you plan to use it for continuous delivery, like I have.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Fernando Barbosa, and this is my technology blog. These past couple of years I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Site Reliability Engineer at a startup, which means I mostly do YAML programming, with the occasional software engineering on the side.
Expect to hear from me about themes such as Continuous Delivery, Kubernetes and, of course, &amp;ldquo;the Cloud&amp;rdquo;.</description>
