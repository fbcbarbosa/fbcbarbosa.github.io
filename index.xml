He has experience with distributed systems, cloud computing and software development, as well as preparing talks and workshops.
He enjoys talking about containers, Golang, Kubernetes and AWS. He&amp;rsquo;s also always learning about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as well as Hiring and Recruiting, and the intersection between these fields.
Previously a developer, he got frustrated with how difficult it was to get code into production and decided to study about continuous delivery.</description></item><item><title>Talks</title><link>https://fernandrone.com/talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fernandrone.com/talks/</guid><description>In 2020 I presented Projecting Disposable Containers: How to Handle Signals in Docker and Kubernetes! at TDCOnline Especial BH.
