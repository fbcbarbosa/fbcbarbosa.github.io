If he would get his way, he would spend his whole day optimizing Dockerfiles. He enjoys talking about containers, Go, Kubernetes, AWS and Observability.
Previously a developer, he got frustrated with how difficult it was to get code into production and decided to study about continuous delivery. That is when he learned about DevOps! He eventually fixed the release pipeline, but now he is doomed to spend the rest of his days writing YAML.</description></item><item><title>Talks</title><link>https://fernandrone.com/talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fernandrone.com/talks/</guid><description>In 2020 I presented Projecting Disposable Containers: How to Handle Signals in Docker and Kubernetes! at TDCOnline Especial BH.
